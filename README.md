# FinanceTrack

## Description

This tracker for a single user.

This project is a simple web application that allows users to track their financial activities. It uses ASP.NET Core, Entity Framework Core, and PostgreSQL. It is still in development and has a lot of work to do. It is still in progress and has some bugs. I will update it as soon as I have time. 

## Dependencies

- ASP.NET Core
- Entity Framework Core
- PostgreSQL

## How to run

- Start postgres if it is not running
- Create a database with `dotnet ef database update`
- Start the server with `dotnet run`
- Open `http://localhost:9910` in your browser
